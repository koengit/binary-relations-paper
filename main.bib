abstract="The concept of redundancy and simplification has been an ongoing theme in Harald Ganzinger's work from his first contributions to equational completion to the various variants of the superposition calculus. When executed by a theorem prover, the inference rules of logic calculi usually generate a tremendously huge search space. The redundancy and simplification concept is indispensable for cutting down this search space to a manageable size. For a number of subclasses of first-order logic appropriate redundancy and simplification concepts even turn the superposition calculus into a decision procedure. Hence, the key to successfully applying first-order theorem proving to a problem domain is to find those simplifications and redundancy criteria that fit this domain and can be effectively implemented.",

pages="148--165",
abstract="Relational logic is useful for reasoning about computational problems with relational structures, including high-level system design, architectural configurations of network systems, ontologies, and verification of programs with linked data structures. We present a modular extension of an earlier calculus for the theory of finite sets to a theory of finite relations with such operations as transpose, product, join, and transitive closure. We implement this extension as a theory solver of the SMT solver CVC4. Combining this new solver with the finite model finding features of CVC4 enables several compelling use cases. For instance, native support for relations enables a natural mapping from Alloy, a declarative modeling language based on first-order relational logic, to SMT constraints. It also enables a natural encoding of several description logics with concrete domains, allowing the use of an SMT solver to analyze, for instance, Web Ontology Language (OWL) models. We provide an initial evaluation of our solver on a number of Alloy and OWL models which shows promising results.",

abstract="In this paper we present a decision procedure for sets, binary relations and partial functions. The language accepted by the decision procedure includes untyped, hereditarily finite sets, where some of their elements can be variables, and basically all the classic set and relational operators used in formal languages such as B and Z. Partial functions are encoded as binary relations which in turn are just sets of ordered pairs. Sets are first-class entities in the language, thus they are not encoded in lower level theories. The decision procedure exploits set unification and set constraint solving as primitive features. The procedure is proved to be sound, complete and terminating. A Prolog implementation is presented.",
